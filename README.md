<h1>Honeynet Implementation and SIEM Threat Analysis in Azure</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I implemented a honeynet solution within Microsoft Azure which was operational for 24hrs to analyze and visualize cyber attack patterns to a virtual machine through brute force failed RDP (remote desktop protocol) requests around the world. The key objectives were to set up an isolated environment for capturing and analyzing malicious activity, and to leverage Azureâ€™s native tools for detailed threat intelligence.
<br />

<h2>Overview</h2>
I created an Azure subscription to initiate the project environment, within Azure, I set up a virtual machine (VM) that will serve as the honeynet by disabling both external and Windows firewalls, exposing the VM to the internet. I established a log repository in Azure through Log Analytics Workspace to ingest failed RDP logs from the VM. Using PowerShell inside the VM, I automated the extraction of IP addresses from failed RDP requests via Windows Event Viewer and sent the data to a third-party API to derive latitude and longitude information. Finally, I configured Azure Sentinel, Azures cloud-native SIEM, to visualize the enrich the attacker data on a map.

<h2>Outcome</h2>
40,000+ API requests on failed RDP attempts into my honeynet virtual machine from over 20 different countries in only 24 hours indicates the threat level to any person or organization remains very high in regards to cybersecurity. Analysing the data from the failed RDP attempts indicates that these were mostly the result of a bots performing automated password-spraying brute force attacks. This is shown by the use of generic usernames such as "Admin", "Server", "User" within seconds of each attempt whilst coming from the same IP Addresses. It is essential to change default usernames, use strong passwords, configure and update firewalls to avoid being breached.
